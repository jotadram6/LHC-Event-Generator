# LHC-Event-Generator

## Description 

An event generator for LHC processes without any physics of the standard model, only the laws of conservation (energy, momentum, spin, charge).
However, the generator doesn't allow to treat protons or any other hadron, just the fundamental particles. It's based on monte carlo methods to genefate
